# Intelligent Narratives for BI - Arria NLG Extension for Qlik Sense

Add natural language generation (NLG) — out-of-the-box — to augment your dashboards

Quickly identify, communicate, and action key insights. This extension provides two powerful components:

- a range of configurable, out-of-the-box NLG narratives for instant, expert analysis and reporting
- an embedded chat platform for rapid answers to specific questions.

Arria&#39;s extension enables you to add natural language generation (NLG) capabilities to your dashboard, generating narratives based on the entire dataset beneath it. With expert narrative generated from the entire dataset, critical facts and insights that might otherwise be missed are now shown—resulting in faster, better-informed decision-making. Use this extension on any dashboard or data model you have in Qlik Sense.

Bridge Qlik Sense to Arria NLG Studio and go beyond out-of-the-box narratives to custom narratives that extract specific insights from the data.

**Highlights:**

• unlimited number of dimensions or measures

• narratives created for any type of data-driven visual

• ask specific questions about your data and get fast, precise answers

• encode your own BI-analyst knowledge into the system

**Features:**

• Arria Apps: Easily configure narratives for your dashboard using apps built for various types of data analysis. See the video here: https://vimeo.com/455877728

• Arria Answers: Query your data for instant insights and deeper detail – separate from your generated narrative within your dashboard. Move back and forth between Answers and narratives generated from Apps. See the video here: https://vimeo.com/455880380

• Multiple deployment models for enterprises: Arria-hosted Public Cloud, Arria-hosted Private Cloud, or Customer-hosted Deployment (behind your firewall).

**Arria Apps include:**

• Descriptive Statistics. This app analyzes measures over combinations of dimensions. It describes any data points that are deemed to be unusual when compared to the mean of the measure.

• Time-Based Variance. This app performs variance analysis and generates narrative to report key insights. It analyzes and reports the performance of one measure between two time periods, along with a breakdown of important drivers and offsets.

• Target-Based Variance. This app performs variance analysis and generates narrative to report key insights. It computes and reports the variance between an actual value and a target or budgeted value; it also drills down through a number of dimensions to build the narrative.

• Describe a Pie Chart. This app performs analysis of a measure by dimension. It describes results as percentages and values, identifying critical insights and explaining the significance of outliers.

• Describe a Bar Chart. This app analyzes measures over combinations of dimensions. It generates narrative reports on the significant statistics and/or variances, as shown in a bar chart.

• Describe a Line Graph. This app analyzes measures over combinations of dimensions, over time. It generates narrative reports on the significant statistics and/or variances, as shown in a line graph.

• Trend Analysis. This app analyzes changes in a measure over time. It highlights significant shifts and drills down through a number of dimensions to build the narrative.

• Ranking Analysis. This app provides a summary of the top and bottom rankings of combinations of dimensions over time, and highlights changes in rank.
