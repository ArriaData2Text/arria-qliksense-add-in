# Natural Language Insights for BI - Arria NLG Extension for Qlik Sense

### Add out-of-the-box or custom narratives for any visuals, or the dataset, across the entire dashboard

With Arria NLG’s add-in for Qlik Sense, you can narrate key facts and insights you want to highlight for your readers using natural language generation (NLG). Arria’s add-in offers three levels of customization:

- **Out-of-the-box insights.** This option lets you tell the add-in what it needs to know to automatically generate insights from your dataset with a few clicks of configuration.

- **Extendable insights.** In this option, you can quickly customize the out-of-the-box narratives by revising narrative scripts in NLG Studio.

- **Programmable narratives.** This option gives you the most flexibility and enables you to create your own custom narratives for specific use cases, with the full programmability of NLG Studio.

By adding Arria’s powerful NLG functionality to your Qlik Sense Desktop, you equip yourself with the ability to generate narratives for any type of data-driven visual, or for underlying data, across the entire dashboard. Now you can generate natural language that explains the most important insights and key drivers, often not captured in your visuals.

**Highlights:**

- Out-of-the-box or fully programmable narratives backed by Arria’s Insight APIs and NLG Studio

- By setting configuration options, you generate narratives suited for your specific use case

- To further customize the out-of-the-box options, you can extend the narrative by modifying scripts in NLG Studio

- No limit to the number of dimensions or measures

**Features:**

- Narratives are fully interactive

- Narratives created for any type of data-driven visual, or even for underlying data not visualized in your report

- Encode your human, BI-analyst knowledge into the system – don’t settle for what’s been written into templates by developers who don’t know your domain.

- Built-in integration of NLG to make your Qlik Sense analytics more informative and easier to understand

   - Tightly coupled workflow between Qlik Sense and NLG Studio for designing, publishing, and connecting the NLG project to the visualization

- Fast-track access to the Arria Store:
   
   - Leverage the work of NLG engineers, data scientists, and other BI developers who have created applications and published them there
