# Natural Language Summaries for BI - Arria NLG Extension for Qlik Sense

### Add narratives for any data-driven visual, or underlying data, across the entire dashboard

With Arria NLG Studio’s Articulate Intelligence you can narrate key facts and insights you want to highlight for your readers using Natural Language Generation.

By adding Arria’s powerful NLG Studio tool to your Qlik Sense Desktop, you equip yourself with the ability to generate narratives for any type of data-driven visual, or for underlying data, across the entire dashboard. Now you can generate natural language that explains the most important insights and key drivers, often not captured in your visuals.

Look at the visuals on your dashboard. How would you explain the critical information, in your own words? What are the main questions you want to answer about the data behind your report? With NLG Studio, you make the narrative express what’s most critical, in the language of the subject matter expert – you.

**Highlights:**

- Immediate contextual awareness across all the data

- Narratives are fully interactive:

   - In selections within visuals
 
   - With filters and drill-downs
- Narratives created for any type of data-driven visual, or even for underlying data not visualized in your report

- Narratives created that draw on data from as many visuals as you like

**Features:**

- Context-aware insights captured in narratives generated with Arria’s cutting-edge NLG capabilities

- Encode your human, BI-analyst knowledge into the system – don’t settle for what’s been written into templates by developers who don’t know your domain.

- Built-in integration of NLG to make your Qlik Sense analytics more informative and easy to understand

   - Tightly coupled workflow between Qlik Sense and NLG Studio for designing, publishing, and connecting the NLG project to the visualization
- Full flexibility for the BI developer – interpret the findings, summarize the key insights, point out specific facts, or tell the whole story in as many words as you need

- Fast-track access to the Arria Store:

   - Leverage the work of NLG engineers, data scientists, and other BI developers who have created applications and published them there
